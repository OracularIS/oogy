# OOGY

## Overview

OOGY is a stand-alone web service that makes it easy to connect and interact with the BY MOCA layer using standard HTTP-based APIs. Acting as a smart integration layer, OOGY allows you to connect in-house systems or third-party applications with MOCA by exposing its commands through simple, well-documented APIs.

Built in Java, OOGY is fully cross-platform and can be hosted on any operating system that supports Java up to Java 17.
