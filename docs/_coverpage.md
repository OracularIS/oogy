The Oracular Open Gateway (OOGY) offers a stand-alone web-service that enables access to the MOCA layer through standard HTTP based APIs. It provides an integration layer between the BY MOCA layer and any in-house or 3rd party application by exposing MOCA commands via API. Because it is written in Java, you can host the web-service on any OS. We invite you for a free trial, which will return 10 rows for the command for a single user per instance. Look at our installation guide and video on our website to help you through the process.
